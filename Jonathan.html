        <h1>Jonathan</h1>
        <p class="TopDescript">
          Jonathan is a college graduate with no debt, he is 23 living with his parents working at mcdonalds. He plans on making money with the lottery, and for this week the lotto max jackpot is 70 million, and will update on june 6. Because he lives with his family he has no rent and gets home cooked meals. The only things he pays for is transportation, clothing and data plan.

          I would still recommend him to live with his parents because it is the most suitable  situation right now. It allows him to save money and not worry about rent or utilities. It will also give him time to focus on his studies and career without the added stress of being alone. Plus, living with his parents will give him the support he needs during this difficult time. Living with his parents will also provide a sense of stability and security. He will have access to a supportive environment with people who understand his needs and can help him reach his goals.

          For account options, I recommend a savings and checking account. These accounts are vital for him, and I would suggest he get an HFSA to save for a home tax-free. Because we want Jonathan to have a reasonable chance of winning the lottery we would take 50% of the check and put that into tickets for the lottery. From his McDonald's job, he would earn $24.83 an hour. This is because Jonathan has nothing else to do and he spends 10 hours a day at his job. So he makes 7 thousand dollars a month. With the ability to save up to $7,000 a month, Jonathan has the potential to save a substantial amount of money for a down payment on a home and to start a retirement fund. Furthermore, the ability to put 50% of his paycheck into lottery tickets gives him a chance to win big and also provides him with a fun and exciting way to save money.

          For his job he commutes there and back every day, he rides on the Mi-Way bus which is $3.20 per ride, he goes 14 times a week and 4 weeks a month so he spends $179.2. He can buy lottery tickets from home so he doesn't need to go to a convenience store. By purchasing the lottery tickets from home, he can save the $179.2 he spends on Mi-Way bus fares every month and use it to buy more lottery tickets. This can potentially increase his chances of winning the lottery.

    <!--Conclusion-->
    <p>
      He is not a materialistic person so he spends $50 a month on clothes. For his data, we will go with Rogers mobile only 5g mobile 50 GB plan with unlimited data. This costs $65 a month. Lastly, I would recommend he play with stocks as it could return some benefits.
