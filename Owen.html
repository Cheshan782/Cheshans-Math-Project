          Owen is a successful business owner, owning a medical company that is
          funded by the government. He is married but has no kids. His annual
          salary is $300,000 annually. He likes to live in the city and wants a
          big house.

          I would suggest to him to get a mortgage because he has the financial
          resources to do so, and it will be beneficial to get some real estate.
          The mortgage rate for a 5-year variable mortgage is %6.45. The reason
          I would go with a variable rate, is because you won't be affected by
          its changing over the years. I would suggest a down payment of
          $300,000 thousand as that is 1 year of your salary so I would say just
          live with your family for that term. With a $300,000 down payment, you
          would get a $1,495,000 mortgage, and with a 6.45% interest rate you will
          pay monthly $16,438.54.

          The accounts I recommend will be an FHSA because building a real estate
          portfolio is going to be beneficial to grow generational
          wealth. I wouldnâ€™t recommend a TFSA account because the limit is
          $6,500, and once you take it out you will be taxed, so as a business
          you will be put in such a high tax bracket it won't be worth it. Some
          ways to avoid taxes are by incorporating your business and hiring
          people you would get benefits like lower tax rates, and it's easier to
          claim capital. Capital is a critical component of running a business
          from day to day and financing its future growth. You should also make
          some donations because Charitable donations over $200 will typically
          bring provincial tax credits between 11.16% (Ontario) source. Tax
          credit refers to an amount of money that taxpayers can subtract
          directly from the taxes they owe. You should also use a Capital
          Dividend Account. The Capital Dividend Account can save you millions
          in tax by allowing life insurance proceeds and the non-taxable portion
          (50%) of capital gains to flow out of the corporation tax-free. For
          example, If your corporation earns a $100,000 capital gain from selling
          a stock, 50% is taxable, and the other 50% is non-taxable. The
          non-taxable portion becomes a Capital Dividend Account credit. In this
          case, $50,000 is taxable, and the other $50,000 can come out of the
          corporation completely tax-free via the Capital Dividend Account.

          Lastly, instead of getting a salary request for a dividend, that is
          why you don't get taxed, because technically you don't have a salary.
          I suggest you get a car that is reliable, and you should just buy it
          with a finance plan. This BMW 3 series is really good, we will finance
          it as it will be better for your BMW. The interest rate is 6.99%, and
          the car itself is $63,498.50, so the monthly payment is $1,158.06. The
          maintenance for this car will get higher and higher like always, but
          the 1-year payment will be $437. Because you probably drive every day I
          would say $300 For gas a monthly payment.

    <!--Conclusion-->
    <p>
      For food, because you have a wife, food will be $600 a month, and extra
      $400 for others. This should cover basic groceries and toiletries.
      Additional costs for entertainment, such as dining out or going to the
      movies, should be factored in separately. The total cost of living should
      be taken into account in budgeting for the household.
