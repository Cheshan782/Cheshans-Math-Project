          Jane is a WNBA player in her late twenties, she is playing in the GTA
          for 2 years as a guard. She is making the average salary of a WNBA
          player which is $60,000/annual according to Sportrac. She is single
          and has no kids, living by herself.

          I will recommend a small apartment in an urban area like Toronto. It
          is close to work facilities, and she can market herself well known in
          the athletic world. We would get her a single-bed apartment and I
          would probably recommend renting it. The average rent for a single bed
          is $2,502 each month according to CTV news.

          Some Account option I would recommend is an FHSA which is a first home
          savings account, this way she can save for her ownership of a house
          and keep some money tax-free. I would also recommend an RRSP as most
          athletes retire early roughly at the age of late thirties. You should
          also incorporate your business because you are technically a social
          representative, you can get a lot of expenses that you can write, and
          you can also hire a family member for extra benefits, for providing
          jobs.

          Lastly, for car payments, we would recommend a car that's good for
          insurance, but also looks nice. I think a jeep wrangler is good for
          insurance as the average is $1,400 annually but because you're in your
          late twenties it would be around two thousand dollars or more. A jeep
          wrangler is a very reliable vehicle and can be worked on by anyone, so
          maintenance for a 12-year Jeep is $700 annually. I found a really cool
          jeep wrangler with some mods, that's 12 yrs old with 240,000km, the
          price is negotiable, but he listed it for $18,000, I think this is a
          good car for you because it's big enough for athletic size, but also
          not as big, with good insurance. Car. In order to pay for this we can
          get a loan, that loan will have a 6% interest rate so you will pay
          $1547.88 a month, and will pay $574.57 extra.

    <!--Conclusion-->
    <p>
      If we add up all your other expenses it will be around $425 monthly, this
      includes $200 for food, $100 for clothes, $75 for wifi data, and $50 for
      other/emergency expenses. We will disperse the rest which is 255.06 into
      our 3 bank accounts, FHSA($150), RRSP($50), and Savings($55.06), I
      wouldn't recommend investing in stocks or start-up business because you
      don't have enough to make shocking outcomes, and it will make your money
      much tighter than needed. You need some liquid cash.
