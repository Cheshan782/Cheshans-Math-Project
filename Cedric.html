          Cedric is a struggling inventor with a wonderful tech invention that
          will make lives easier , however, this invention is still in the
          sketch phase and will be for a while. He is single with no kids and
          needs a calm work environment, he is 21 years old. He doesn't want an
          extraordinary lifestyle, as long as his inventions reach many hands.
          He has a part-time job to make ends meet and to allow him to find time
          to make his invention. Therefore he is making $2648. It is not a lot
          so he needs to start sharing stuff.

          We will get him a studio apartment in Calgary and make him share with
          a roommate. The average rent for a studio in Calgary is $1569 Zumper.
          We will find 1 roommate who will also be his business partner. It may
          seem hard to share a studio apartment, but it is doable spacewise. Now
          his rent is $784.5, this is good for him to rent because permanent
          living situations are only good for people with stable incomes,
          however, Cedric does not have that so its better to get a mad
          landlord than a bank.

          The account I recommend him having is a TFSA account because of
          tax-free you can take it out when you get much richer but you won't be
          holding that as your income. Although the limit is $6,500 I would
          recommend keeping the leftover and keeping it liquid as it is needed
          to build prototypes and to invest into that invention of yours. A TFSA
          account is technically liquid because you can take it out whenever you
          want, however, you're going to get taxed for it as the government
          recognizes it as income. Stocks are good investments in your situation
          but Cedric should only invest 20% of his savings after every other
          expense is paid.

          Lastly, his car. I wouldn't recommend he get a car, because I don't
          think it would be worth it in Calgary because there is nowhere to go,
          therefore I would tell him to invest in a bus pass. I would go on the
          bus 20 times a month which is 10 trips. I think that is plenty for
          someone whose only reason for going out should just be for food or
          getting materials for his invention. An adult fare is $3.60 and lasts
          90 minutes fares. Therefore monthly he should spend somewhere around
          $72.

    <!--Conclusion-->
    <p>
      For other things, he should spend $300 including food, clothes, tech, and
      wifi cable. This leaves $1491.5 he should do 80% ($1196.8) investing in
      himself and 20% ($298.3) savings for the future. I think Cedric should
      take this risk because he is already deeply invested in his invention, so
      this budget will set him up for success, with a little emergency money.
